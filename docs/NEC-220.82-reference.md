# NEC Article 220.82 Reference Guide

## Overview

**NEC 220.82 Optional Calculation — One-Family Dwelling Unit**

This optional calculation method provides a simplified approach for determining the service load for single-family dwellings. It is less conservative than the standard method in Article 220 Part III.

---

## 220.82(A) When Optional Method Applies

The optional calculation applies to:
- One-family dwellings
- Service rating of 100A or greater
- Entire dwelling unit (not additions)

---

## 220.82(B) General Loads

### Calculation Steps

1. **General Lighting and Receptacles**
   ```
   General Lighting VA = Habitable Square Footage × 3 VA/sq ft
   ```
   
   Habitable space excludes: garages, unfinished basements, attics, porches

2. **Small-Appliance Branch Circuits**
   ```
   Small-Appliance VA = Number of Circuits × 1500 VA
   ```
   
   **NEC 210.11(C)(1):** Minimum 2 circuits required for kitchen, pantry, breakfast room, dining room

3. **Laundry Circuit**
   ```
   Laundry VA = Number of Circuits × 1500 VA
   ```
   
   **NEC 210.11(C)(2):** Minimum 1 circuit required

4. **Fixed Appliances**
   Include nameplate VA of all permanently connected appliances:
   - Electric ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units
   - Electric clothes dryers
   - Water heaters
   - Dishwashers
   - Garbage disposals
   - Furnace blowers
   - Any other permanently connected equipment

### Demand Factor Application

After summing all general loads:

```
First 10,000 VA    → 100%
Remainder          → 40%
```

**Formula:**
```
Demanded VA = 10,000 + (Total_General - 10,000) × 0.40
```

## 220.82(C) Heating and Air-Conditioning Load

### Rule: Use the LARGER of Heating or Cooling

**Do NOT add heating and cooling together.** Only the larger load is used since both cannot operate simultaneously at peak.

### Heating Load (include all):
- Electric furnace
- Electric baseboard heaters
- Electric boiler
- Heat pump supplementary heat (if controlled to prevent simultaneous operation with compressor)
- Fixed electric space heating

### Cooling Load (include all):
- Central air conditioning
- Window AC units (if permanently connected)
- Heat pump compressor

### Calculation:
```
HVAC_Load = max(Heating_VA, Cooling_VA) × 100%
```

**No demand factor applies to HVAC loads.**

---

## Final Calculation

```
Total VA = Demanded_General_VA + HVAC_VA
Amps = Total VA ÷ 240V
```

### Recommended Service Sizes

Standard residential service ratings (NEC 240.6):
- 100A (minimum per 230.79(C))
- 125A
- 150A
- 200A
- 400A
- 600A

---

## NEC 230.79(C) Minimum Service Rating

**Dwellings:** Minimum 100A, 3-wire service

Even if calculation yields less than 100A, the service must be sized at 100A minimum.

## Example Calculation

### Inputs:
- Habitable area: 2,800 sq ft
- Small-appliance circuits: 2
- Laundry circuits: 1
- Electric range: 12,000 VA
- Electric dryer: 5,000 VA
- Water heater: 4,500 VA
- Heating: 15,000 VA
- Air conditioning: 8,000 VA

### Step 1: General Loads
| Load Type | Calculation | VA |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| General lighting | 2,800 × 3 | 8,400 |
| Small-appliance | 2 × 1,500 | 3,000 |
| Laundry | 1 × 1,500 | 1,500 |
| Range | nameplate | 12,000 |
| Dryer | nameplate | 5,000 |
| Water heater | nameplate | 4,500 |
| **Total General** | | **34,400** |

### Step 2: Apply Demand Factor
```
Demanded = 10,000 + (34,400 - 10,000) × 0.40
Demanded = 10,000 + 9,760
Demanded = 19,760 VA
```

### Step 3: HVAC Load
```
HVAC = max(15,000, 8,000) = 15,000 VA
```

### Step 4: Total Load
```
Total VA = 19,760 + 15,000 = 34,760 VA
Amps = 34,760 ÷ 240 = 145 A
```

### Step 5: Recommended Service
```
Next standard size ≥ 145A = 150A
```

**Result: 150A service required**

## Important Notes

1. **Square footage** is based on habitable area only (excludes garage, unfinished spaces)

2. **Electric vehicle charging** is NOT included in optional calculation — add separately per 220.57

3. **Swimming pool equipment** is NOT included — add separately per 220.50

4. **Generators** — optional calculation can be used for generator sizing but consider starting currents

5. **Solar/battery systems** — calculation determines service size, not backup requirements
